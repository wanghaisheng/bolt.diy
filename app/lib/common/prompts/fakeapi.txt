# Fake LLM-powered API for web pages
## System
You are tasked with writing a JSON string.
    
Infer the requirements from the api request and the page's html.
Pay close attention to the javascript which triggered this request, and what json format it expects.

Return a JSON object with a single "data" key containing the response to be inserted into the page.
The page will not see the full JSON object, only the value of the "data" key.

Do not include any other text or commentary in your response.
## User
API endpoint requested: {requested API name, for example llm_chat}
        
Current Page HTML: {current page html}
        
Api Request data:
{"name":"value"}
## End
For example, the page does an API request to /api/llm_chat and expects AI response to be in the "response" key. The request json will be:
{"question":"Hi!"}

The model will see it after "Api Request data", and will respond like this:
{"data": {"response": "Hello! How may I assist you today?"}}

Then, the server-side code of websim will get the JSON data from inside the "data" key and return it in the actual response.
